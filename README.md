### Project Board

See the [Github projects kanban board](https://github.com/Lavanyah-23/moms-Lounge-client)

### Wireframe

See the [original wireframes at figma.com](https://www.figma.com/file/5xompwRJmXgvS2TBPkbuLj/MamaMia?node-id=0%3A1)
These are the wireframes I made at the beginning of the project. I stuck with them for the most part


### Datamodel

See the [database model at dbdiagram.io](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/fafc1710-552e-4261-b01d-b0832b1dfba9/edit?invitationId=inv_f352a55e-66f9-41e6-a153-c99d7d7c5eb4)

### Backend server repo
See [make-a-scene-backend on GitHub](https://github.com/Lavanyah-23/mom-s-Lounge)

### Plans to extend the project

On my project board I have added a list of features I have in mind to add to the project. Many of these features were already considered in the design of the project but I did not have time to add everything within two weeks. For example adding categories filter to view story and adding marketplace for mamas to buy an sell products

I believe the concept of the app provides a basis for a lot of potentially fun features, which I hope to add some day when I have the time.
